# Kindling

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nchaloult/kindling.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nchaloult/kindling)

## Notes to Self

The instructions below aren't very good. They serve more as reminders for me as I revisit this project periodically, rather than instructions for people unfamiliar with the project.

### Getting Up and Running

1. `docker-compose up -d`
1. `go run main.go`

### Testing

1. `go test -coverprofile cover.out ./...`
1. `go tool cover -html=cover.out -o cover.html`
1. `open cover.html`

# To-Do List

## New Features

* `HEAD` endpoint to check for a message's existence
    * This could be helpful in your `message_repository.DeleteMessageByID()` func

## Refactoring/Restructuring

I have a lot to learn about structuring an app like this.

How I've chosen to organize things is most definitely overkill for a project of this size, but I wanted to practice building something that could go large without having to tweak the structure. As far as I can tell, there isn't a small set of widely-adopted conventions for Go projects, which has made learning Go more challenging (a fun challenge, though ðŸ˜ƒ).

I learned about dependency injection while working on this project in its initial stages. I'd like to use [wire](https://github.com/google/wire) in this project one day.

[This article](https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/structuring-applications-in-go-3b04be4ff091) has inspired me to reconsider particular aspects of this project's organization, especially how I hit the database, and how I mock results from functions in `*_repository` files.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage sucks right now. That's embarrassing for how small this project is.

Most of the gaps in code coverage by tests are because I haven't written any `*_repository_test`s. I haven't figured out how to mock results coming from a database. I need to either:

* Set up a separate database for tests
    * Get this stood up by including something like `psql -c 'create database travis_ci_test;' -U postgres` in the `before_script` section of the `.travis.yml` file
        * https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#postgresql
    * Then, also in the `before_script` section, create all of the tables that you need in that new testing database, and insert some testing data
        * Not sure if there's a better way to do this than with `psql` commands in `.travis.yml`
        * Database migrations? Need to do some research on what these are and how they work
* Look into something like [this mock SQL driver](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock)
    * Seems like this would stand in the place of the `github.com/lib/pq` package, in my case
